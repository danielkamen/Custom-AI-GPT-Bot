Women’s Clinics
Thursdays are
for Women!
Check Back in the Fall for 23/24 Rates
On snow with a PSIA Certified female coach for fun, comradery, informal instruction, and opportunity to meet new friends and share your same skiing passion with other women.  The event is way more than just a lesson. You’ll find exactly what you need. You will progress at your own pace while getting some great winter exercise – it’s like making Wachusett your own outdoor gym. This program is designed to build skills for skiers and riders who are comfortable traversing green terrain (from our Monadnock chairlift) while controlling speed with turns.  
Program includes:
6 weeks of Clinic Sessions
Food Voucher
Bronze Pass available for purchase (if you do not already have a season pass)
Demo Day to try contemporary equipment from our high performance Demo Center.  This opportunity is included in the price of the program.  Dates for Demo Days TBD
