Adaptive Lessons









Opening the outdoors to everyone!

We work to help people of all ages and abilities enjoy winter snow sports. Since 1984 the Wachusett Adaptive Program has grown to be one of the finest in Massachusetts and is respected throughout New England. We are proud to be able to serve the Special Needs community.
The Wachusett Mountain Adaptive Program uses up-to-date techniques and equipment to create a lesson environment which helps individuals build confidence and self-esteem while promoting independence and personal growth. Our objective is to provide an experience that will bring joy and a feeling of freedom to our students.
Our instructor staff is trained in dealing with physical, cognitive, hearing, visually impaired and developmental disabilities. The lessons are given in an atmosphere that is enthusiastic and upbeat.

Our staff works with students to: 

Identify their challenges
Set attainable goals
Introduce new skills
Refine skills and gain confidence
Enjoy the outdoors and have fun

Lesson times and fees are determined by equipment needed and length of lesson.
For more information or to schedule a lesson, please email [email protected] or call 978-464-2300 ext 3308.
